Problems on Leetcode

I made this repo after a failed technical interview with an easy programming question (Game of life). It reminded me of another technical interview with an easy question that I failed. I realized simply taking a class in Algorithms and Data Structures wasn't enough, and that I needed to practice more questions. A few weeks before Chrismast 2016, I set out a goal of doing one problem on Leetcode a day.

I've switched to a more structured way of learning algorithms (with topics and problems on the topic to familiarize myself using Competitive Programming by Steven and Felix Halim). I will still do problems on Leetcode once in a while.

# Structure

This repo has a flat structure with no sub directories. For the problems, I tried solving them first, then if stuck I would look at the solution, then I tried to reimplement them.

# Lessons learned
The journey in the past 8-9 months has been fun. It taught me discipline. I realized that if I want to be good at something I need to constantly practice it. Sitting down to my laptop everyday and tried to read and understand the problems and created a commit has shaped a habit in my mind. I'm no longer afraid of doing a technical programming question (I still suck at that, though). An author on Quora has said habitual everyday tasks are boring, but they bring me greater rewards in the future. At least, at the end of the day, when I reflect on what I've done today, I'm glad I did something to better myself

I also welcome contributions.
